ExcelReaderXML
==============

Reads XML files generated by Microsoft Excel
Inspired by simple and fast ExcelWriterXML[http://excelwriterxml.sourceforge.net/]

=== Advantages:
* Uses XMLReader and can parse even very large files
* Fast and simple, and memory conservative

=== Example:
<code>
include "ExcelReaderXML.php";

$xml = new ExcelReaderXML('spreadsheet.xml');

while ($spreadsheet_name = $xml->readSpreadsheet()) {
	echo "Spreadsheet: $spreadsheet_name\n";
	while ($row = $xml->readRow()) {
		print_r($row);
	}
}
</code>

=== Not done:
* Excel format check (in case of invalid file - library just don't return anything)
* You know what
